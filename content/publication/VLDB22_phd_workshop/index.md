abstract: Academia, industry, and societies are showing increasing interest in the possibilities of quantum computing. The research in the intersection of quantum computing and databases is still in its initial steps. This work represents several crucial data management and query processing problems that will benefit from quantum computing. We outline how quantum computing will tackle these challenges and what kind of outcomes and speed-ups we expect. We discuss the position of quantum computing in data management and raise awareness of possible security threats in encryption. We aim to be realistic and point out technical difficulties that currently restrict implementations.
